            Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real
            estate marketing company?
          </h2>

          <p class="Benefits__p">
            One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your property to the
            right target audience.
            A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who will be interested in your property and 
            implement effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means.
            When you work with an agent who has partnered with <u>Luxury Presence</u>, you benefit from the many different types of marketing
            capabilities the company offers.

            To reach your potential buyers, <u>you have to know who they are</u>, where they spend their time online, and how
            they make their buying decisions.
            Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your niche market, then create
            paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
            These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to
            those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

          <p class="Expert__p">
            Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent
            has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content
            such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents
            who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors.
            According to a recent survey, <u>85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with
            an agent who uses video</u>â€”and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to
            connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport.

            When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would
            really be like to walk through and live in your homeâ€”something that is much more
            difficult to do with a written description.
            However, written descriptionsâ€”or copywritingâ€”is also important. Your property needs
            to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional
            marketing that is created to sell it. 

            Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get
            access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and
            content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

        <h1>Effective Search Engine Optimization</h1>

        <article>
          <img src="images/SEO_analisis.jpg" alt="SEO analytics">
          <p class="Effective__p">
            Recent research has shown that <u>44% of buyers found the home they purchased</u>
            on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted
            in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show up in these
            types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online
            marketing. 
            
            The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization
            or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a
            scienceâ€”one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered.
            
            When a potential
            buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results
            and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

          <p class="SocialMedia__p">
            If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands
            of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs
            to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real
            estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them.
            
            Wouldnâ€™t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media
            presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agentâ€™s stories and feed
            posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once theyâ€™ve harnessed the
            power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it
            more quickly than their competitors.

            Every real estate agentâ€™s success starts with their website.
            If an agent doesnâ€™t have a responsive, user-friendly website that is easy to
            navigate and provides an immersive experience for viewers who want to look at properties,
            theyâ€™ve already lost their advantage. 

            Those agents who work with Luxury Presence have
            websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals who know what property
            buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities, and
            lead capture strategies that help agents sell your home.

            Agents are further supported by analytics reporting, SEO optimization, third party integrations,
            and a reporting dashboard to help them easily utilize their site and maximize its potential.
            An agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who can easily reach a niche audience,
            streamline the selling process, and ensure your home gets the best promotion possible.
